<h1>Steve Jobs</h1>
<img src="C:\Users\Jarvis\Pictures\">
<p>Steve Jobs was an American business magnate, industrial designer, investor, and media proprietor. He was the chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), and co-founder of Apple Inc.; the chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar Animation Studios; a member of The Walt Disney Company's board of directors following its acquisition of Pixar; and the founder, chairman, and CEO of NeXT. Jobs is widely recognized as a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with his early business partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.</p>

<p>Jobs was born in San Francisco, California, to a Syrian father and German-American mother. He was adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs, a lower-middle-class couple, who moved to the suburban city of Mountain View a couple of years later. Jobs attended Reed College in 1972 before withdrawing that same year. In 1974, he traveled through India seeking enlightenment before later studying Zen Buddhism. He and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Together the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with production and sale of the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers.</p>

<p>Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985 after a power struggle with the company's board of directors. He then founded NeXT, a computer platform development company, in 1986. In 1996, Apple bought NeXT and Jobs returned to the company as its CEO. He revived the company and led it to a period of great success, introducing the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad. Jobs died of pancreatic cancer on October 5, 2011.</p>

<p>Jobs was a charismatic and visionary leader who changed the way we interact with technology. His products have had a profound impact on our lives, and his legacy will continue to inspire people for generations to come.</p>
